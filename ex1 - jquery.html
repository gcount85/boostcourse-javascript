        </br>Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, <br>
        everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and<br>
        suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every<br>
        hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in<br>
        love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt<br>
        politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species<br>
        lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.<br>
