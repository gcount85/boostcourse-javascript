    <h2>Pale Blue Dot</h2>
    
    <p>
    </br>Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, <br>
    everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and<br>
    suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every<br>
    hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in<br>
    love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt<br>
    politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species<br>
    lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.<br>
